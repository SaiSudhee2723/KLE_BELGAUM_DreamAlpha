# Sahayak AI v2.0 — Offline Multimodal Medical Assistant

> Asteria Hackathon | Team DreamAlpha | Built for ASHA workers in Rural India

---

## 🏆 What This Is

Sahayak AI is a **voice-first, multilingual clinical decision support system** designed for ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers in rural India. It empowers semi-trained frontline health workers with specialist-level triage guidance — working even without internet connectivity.

## 🏗 Architecture: Demo vs Production

| Component | Hackathon Demo | Production (AMD Ryzen AI NPU) |
|---|---|---|
| Speech-to-Text | Groq Whisper API | Faster-Whisper INT8 via ONNX Runtime + DirectML |
| Clinical Reasoning | Groq LLaMA-3.3-70B | Phi-3-Mini AWQ (4-bit quantised) via ONNX Runtime |
| Vector Search | FAISS CPU (local) | FAISS CPU (local) — same in both |
| Text-to-Speech | gTTS (requires brief internet) | Coqui-TTS / Indic-TTS (fully offline) |
| Patient Data | Local SQLite | Local SQLite — zero cloud sync |

The demo environment uses the Groq API as a **drop-in OpenAI-compatible replacement** for the local ONNX models. The API interface is identical — switching to local models requires only changing the `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `LLM_MODEL` config values.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Groq API key (free at console.groq.com)

### 2. Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure
Create a `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
LLM_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile
WHISPER_MODEL=whisper-large-v3
```

### 4. Build the medical knowledge index
```bash
cd data
python ingest_guidelines.py
cd ..
```

### 5. Run
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open http://localhost:8000
